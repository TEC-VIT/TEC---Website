## Our Vision

At TEC-VIT we strive to bring the ‘technological best’ in you. We aim to fill in the void of Electronics hobbyists in the institute by providing a platform where the theory learnt in classes can be applied in the real world. Through various educational programs like project expos and practical sessions, we aim to equip budding engineers with the latest and the best technologies out there. While technical excellence remains a constant endeavor, we always try to keep the team spirit up and high. The club believes that individual importance is a key to success.
